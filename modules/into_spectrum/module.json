  "description": "Server-side media player with a web front-end, written in NodeJS.\nThe interface is mainly based on Bootstrap 3.\nNote that IntoSpectrum doesn't create the library for you, at least not with the web app.\nInstead, it comes with a watchdog utility script, which can be launched once, or as a daemon process.\n\nWhy IntoSpectrum ?\nIts an anagram of the original author's last names, and also happens to correspond to one of our favorite pokemon."
